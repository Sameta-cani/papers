## Abstract

This paper reports on a shared task involving the assignment of emotions to suicide notes. Two features distinguished this task from previous shared tasks in the biomedical domain.
1. One is that it resulted in the corpus of fully anonymized clinical text and annotated suicide notes.
2. It required categorization with respect to a large set of labels.

## Introduction

In this paper we describe the 2011 challenge to classify the emotions found in notes left behind by those who have died by suicide. A total of 106 scientists who comprised 24 teams responded to the call for participation. 

## Background Content of Notes 

What is written in the note of a person who committed suicide
- wish to be killed
- anger of revenge
- less likely to have escape as a motive
- self-blame or self-punishment
- rich in emotions, and often begging for forgiveness(young people were longer)
- adult trauma, expressions of ambivalence

### Using suicide notes for clinical purpose

We found significant difference between the linguistic and emotional characteristics of the notes.
**Linguistic differences (completer/simulated)**
- word count 120/66, P = 0.007
- verbs 25/13, P = 0.012
- nouns 28/12, P = 0.0001
- prepositions 20/10, P = 0.005

**Emotional differences**: completers gave away their possessions 20% of the time, simulated, never did.

## Corpus Preparation

The corpus used for this shared task contain the notes that were written by 1319 people before they died by suicide(1950 ~ 2011).

### Annotators

It is the role of an annotator to review a note and select which words, phrases or sentences represent a particular emotion.

### Emotional assignment 

Each note in the shared task’s training and test set was annotated at least three times. Annotators were asked to identify the following emotions: abuse, anger, blame, fear, guilt, hopelessness, sorrow, forgiveness, happiness, peacefulness, hopefulness, love, pride, thankfulness, instructions, and information.

## Evaluation

### Micro- and macro-averaging

Micro-averaging may be preferred if the density of a class reflects its importance in the end-user system. For the present biomedical application, we are more interested in a system's ability to reflect the intent. We, therefore, emphasize the micro-average.

### Systems comparison

We used hierarchical clustering with minimum variance aggregation technique to create a dendrogram that will cluster similar system outputs in the same branches. The distance between submissions was calculated using inverse $F_1$ score ($d = 1 F_1$ ).

## Results

### Characteristics of the data

### Ranking

This suggests that appropriate ensemble of sentence classifiers might perform much better than a single instance classifier or even better than an ensemble of human experts.
